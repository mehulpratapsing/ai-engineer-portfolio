üõ† Fix: Resolving Dependency Errors in npm
Step 1Ô∏è‚É£: Run npm install with legacy peer deps
Since date-fns@4.1.0 conflicts with react-day-picker@8.10.1, try:


#This allows npm to ignore strict dependency resolutions and install everything.
bash
npm install --legacy-peer-deps 

Step 2Ô∏è‚É£: If Step 1 Fails, Force Install
If the above command doesn‚Äôt work, force the installation:

bash
npm install --force
‚ö†Ô∏è Note: This might break some dependencies, but it should install everything.

Step 3Ô∏è‚É£:Verify Installed Versions
If issues persist, manually check dependencies in package.json:
npm list date-fns react-day-picker

Step 4Ô∏è‚É£: Run the Project
npm run dev
